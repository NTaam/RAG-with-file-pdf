There is one more folder containing the model, but it is too large for me to upload. 

To run the project, first you need to upload the PDF file to the "data" folder. 
Then run the "prepare_vector_db.py" file. Next, go to the "aqbot.py" file, scroll to the bottom and edit your prompt. 
Finally, run that file. Note: The parameters will need to be adjusted based on your data.
